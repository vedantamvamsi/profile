![Artificial Intelligence](/images/aboutme.jpg)

As a highly-skilled professional with experience in FinTech, MedTech, Telecom and ICT Data science roles, I develop complex data-driven products using various data science methodologies. I worked with organizations from different parts of the world, including Europe, the US and India and developed various Advanced Analytics solutions to help businesses make critical decisions using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

When I look back at my experience as a whole, the common thread is researching and delivering efficient Data Science solutions including models for decision-making under conditions of uncertainty as well as experimental and descriptive studies of decision-making behaviour. As a Data Science technology evangelist, I perform economic analysis of competitive and strategic decisions, approaches for facilitating decision-making by groups and utilising advanced mathematical and statistical modeling techniques.

I have written and published articles on critical fields in Data Science on various International Journals and publication platforms. Participated in several international events on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning including panel member in University of Technology, Sydney.
